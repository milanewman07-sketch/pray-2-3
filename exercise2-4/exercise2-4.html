    <h1>Exercise 2.4</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Warning: this exercise is quite challenging but it has a simple solution! Copy-paste your code from the previous exercise into <code>exercise2-4/sketch.js</code>.</p>
            <p>Modify your code from the previous exercise to create a checkerboard effect as shown below.</p>
            <p>The key to this task actually has nothing to do with loops--it just requires a little maths inside 
                your inner loop. You can think of the problem like this:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every even numbered square in an even numbered row (assuming we're counting from 0 because we're programmers) should be black. Odd numbered squares in even numbered rows should be white.</li>
                <li>Every odd numbered square in an odd numbered row should be black and every even numbered square in an odd numbered row should be white.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder" target="_blank">remainder operator (%, also known as modulo)</a> is very useful for this problem!</p>
            <p>When you are done, check your work using <a href="./check-exercise2-4.html">check-exercise2-4.html</a>.</p>
            <p>For an extension activity, try modifying your solution to use <code>for</code> loops instead of <code>while</code> loops.</p>
            <p>Expected output:</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <button class="btn btn-primary hint" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#hint" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="hint">
                Hint
            </button>
            <div class="collapse" id="hint">
                <div class="card card-body">
                    <p>Don't modify your loops from the previous exercise.
                    </p>
                    <p>Inside the inner loop and before you draw the square, add an if-else statement with a placeholder / space for the boolean expression. If the boolean expression is 
                        true, set the fill to black. If the boolean expression is false, set the fill to white.
                    </p>
                    <p>The hardest part is to figure out what the boolean expression should be. As noted above, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder" target="_blank">remainder operator</a> is 
                        very useful here. For all black squares, the x and y coordinates are divisible by the same number. Figure out what that number is 
                        and express it using the % (remainder/modulo) operator.
